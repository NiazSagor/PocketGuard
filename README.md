PocketGuard is a modern, high-performance personal finance manager built with Flutter. It focuses on speed, privacy, and a clean user experience to help you take control of your spending without the clutter of traditional banking apps.

## 🛠️ Features

-   **Intelligent Records** Quickly log expenses so you can get back to spending.

-   **Dynamic Categories**  Customizable categories with a built-in emoji picker. Finally, a place to categorize your "Late Night Pizza" 🍕 and "Emergency Stationery" 🖊️ with the color-coded respect they deserve.

-   **Smart Navigation**  A `SliverAppBar` that hides when you scroll down. It’s basically the app's way of saying, _"I’ll look away while you scroll through your bad decisions, but I'll pop right back if you need to check the date."_

-   **Visual Insights**  Real-time statistics powered by a reactive Provider architecture. It turns your financial reality into pretty charts, because bad news is easier to swallow when it’s a nice shade of orange.

-   **Premium Experience**  Support for custom icons and expanded palettes. No more seasonal images of falling leaves to remind you that your "fun money" is also falling. Just clean, minimalist design for the sophisticated spender.

## 🎨 Design System

PocketGuard uses a sophisticated design language tailored for readability and financial clarity.

-   **Primary Brand Color:** Energetic, modern, and bold.

-   **Typography:** **Inter** via Google Fonts. Chosen for its exceptional legibility and tabular numerical alignment.

-   **UI Philosophy:** Material 3 logic with a focus on "Surface" colors to reduce eye strain.


----------

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

-   **Framework:** [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (Latest Stable)

-   **State Management:** [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) & `ChangeNotifier` for reactive UI updates.

-   **Local Database:** SQLite (via `sqflite`) for 100% offline-first privacy.

-   **Architecture:** Optimized "Business Logic in Provider" pattern to ensure smooth 60fps animations.

-   **Icons:** FontAwesome & Material Symbols.
